# Briefly Description of this Project
What is the purpose of our project?

Our project is designed for a university student who is willing to :
1. find a mentor for academic purposes
2. find a mentor or see someone's experience in a career (i.e. include internship)
3. find a teammate or colleague to attend an event
4. find a teammate to build a project together.

Why does this project come out?

We intend to create a website to create a better social networking platform for students in any university worldwide. Due to COVID-19, we observe that people have less chance to connect with others.

How will this project work?

We will build a website that includes four main categories: academic, career, project, and event. Each category will provide specific information and resources tailored to the needs of university students.
Students can find some information based on their interest in these four categories.
  
# Motivation
Recently, the job market has not been good. Students may need a referral to get a job. However, due to COVID-19 and online courses, many students did not have the chance to make friends or connect with colleagues. Therefore, this project comes to mind as we would like to provide a platform for students to broaden their social network as well as offer guidance with career choices, academics, and allowing students to work on projects together.

# Installation

## Workflow & Branch Naming
This project will use the "Git flow" workflow.
This means that we will have the following branches:

1. Main branch: A branch that deploys websites.

2. Hotfix branch: A branch to fix an emergency bug from the Main branch.

3. Release branch: A branch pre-processes and tests the deployment code before merging into the Main branch.

4. Development branch: A branch that stores collections of change or adds new features.

5. Feature branch: A branch that creates a new feature or modifies an existing branch. 

Format of each branch:

Main branch: 
- version[number] 
  - For example, version1.0

Release branch: 
- release/[future version number]  
  -  For example, release/1.0
- We will add the subsequence number if a bug is found during code integration or automated testing. 
  - For example, release/1.1

Development branch:
- DEV-[number of sprint] 
  - For example, if this is the first sprint, then the number will be DEV-1.0
- If there is a bug found in the release branch and merged back to the Development branch, then we will add the number to the Development version.
  - For example, DEV-1.1

Feature branch:
- DEV-1-[feature name]. 
  - For example, if we implement the login feature, the possible feature branch will be DEV-1-LoginPage.
## Issues
We will use the git issue to mention a potential question.

## Before Merge to Development Branch
We will use the git pull request before merging to the Development branch. So that, everyone can use the pull request from development branch to their local branch after new change.
