## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

* **When**: 2024-07-19
* **Where**: Discord

## Process - Reflection

The sprint overall was not as good as prior sprints due to final assignment build up.

### Decisions that Turned Out Well

Process-related decisions that were successful:

1. The addition of extra discussions between standups allowed us to clarify ideas and concepts, keeping everyone on task.
2. Using bugs in the Jira board helped us catch logic and runtime errors effectively.
3. We supported each other by sharing workloads during the final assignment period.

### Decisions that Did Not Turn Out as Well as Hoped

Process-related decisions that were less successful:

1. The tasks section on the Jira board was still underutilized but did allow for clarity on what to work on.
2. Many of us were busy due to finals season beginning, a couple of the feature choices were heavy.

### Planned Changes

1. We intended to continue to add on to the search bar feature though due to implementation mishaps we were not able to finish this.

## Product - Review

### Goals and/or Tasks that Were Met/Completed

1. **Video Notes**
   - Most of the video note page was created.
2. **Group Pages**
   - Most of the group page and ability was .
3. **UI for Pages**
   - Changes to the Posts was created and Project was improved.

### Goals and/or Tasks that Were Planned but Not Met/Completed

1. We still intended to add project cards, user cards, and post cards into the search bar. However, this was an overestimation of our capacity, and only the post cards were completed.

## Meeting Highlights

Key insights for the next iteration:

1. The addition of extra meetings and bug tracking allowed us to stay informed about the project's current state.
2. Clarification meetings helped us understand high-level concepts in the code.
3. Distributing tasks based on their difficulty and considering each team member's current workload helped reduce stress and improve efficiency.
