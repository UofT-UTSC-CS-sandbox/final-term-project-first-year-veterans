## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

* When: 2024-06-15
* Where: Online (Discord)

## Process - Reflection

We learned quite a lot within a short amount of time, including Neo4j, React, and JavaScript. We discovered that building things and experimenting was the best way to learn quickly.

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- Regular standups ensured that we all were on pace with learning and developing.
- The meeting notes were convenient as they allowed those who were unable to attend to stay updated. They also helped us recall what the standup goals were.
- Informal meetings with both front-end and back-end teams kept everyone on the same page.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as we thought they would be.

- Watching videos was our initial plan to learn quickly, but we found that hands-on learning was more efficient. However, the videos were good for initial starts.
- We initially decided on using Express.js for our database but later switched to Neo4j, as it was better for handling relationships, which worked better for our website.

#### Planned changes

- So far, we do not intend on changing many plans.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

Completed:

- Added the search bar feature.
- Added the profile page and local modification.
- Added filters for major, users, posts, and projects.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

Incomplete:

- We intended to enable profile modification, but we were not able to finish it by the demo date.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Richie is MVP, he aided in efficient learning.
- Learning is a hands-on experience, not just listening to videos.
- We intend to add a sign-up page, allowing us to include live users/data compared to fixed data. This will also mean the potential for more bugs.
